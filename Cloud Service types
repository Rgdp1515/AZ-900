## IaaS ##
The most flexible category, as it provides the maximum amount of control for your resources.
- CSP is responsible for hardware, network connectivity, and physical security.
- You are responsible for the rest: OS installation, configuration, maintenance; network configuration;
database and storage configuration.
- You rent the hardware
Where IaaS makes sense:
- Lift-and-shift migration: moving from on-prem datacenter to a similar cloud infrastructure
- Testing and development: established configurations you need to replicate, with complete control

## PaaS ##
  Middle ground between renting space in a datacetner (IaaS) and paying for a complete solution (SaaS)
- CSP maintains physical infrastructure and security, and connection to the internet. They maintain OS,
dev tools, business intelligence services.
- You maintain updates, patches, refreshes.
Where PaaS makes sense:
- Development frameworks: developers use built-in software components
- Analytics or BI: tools provided allow analysis and actions on business decisions

## SaaS ##
  The most complete model. essentially renting a fully developed application. Easiest to set up.
- CSP has most responsibility.
- You are only responsible for the data you put in the system, the devices you connect, the users that have access.
Where SaaS makes sense:
- Email and messaging
- Business productivity applications
- Finance and Expense tracking
