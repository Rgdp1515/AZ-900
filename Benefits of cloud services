## High availability and scalability in the cloud ##
 Two biggest considerations are uptime and demand

## High availability ##
  This is usually achieved through redundancy
SLA - agreement between providers and consumers requiring minimumm levels of availability
 % Up Time (99%-99.99%) - big difference in between them
 Longest Down time acceptable

## Scalability ##
  Refers to the ability to adjust resources to meet demand.
  Ensures you are not overpaying for services, you pay for what you use.
- Generally vertical and horizontal
  - Vertical: focuses on increasing or decreasing the capabilities of resources
You can add more CPUs or RAM to a VM if you needed more processing power
  - Horizontal: focuses on adding or subtracting the number of resources
You can add VMs or containers to supplement demand.

## Reliability and Predictability ##

## Reliability ##
  The abillity of a system to recover from failures and continue to functions.
  The cloud is decentralized by design, supporting reliability.

## Predicability ##
  Can be performance or cost.
 - Performance: focuses on resources needed.
    - Autoscaling, load balancing, high availability
 - Cost: forecasting of the cloud spend.
    - Reail-time monitoring, predict future costs from patterns 

## Security and governance ##
  Set templates ensure resources meet corporate standards and government regulatory requirements. 
  Cloud-based auditing flags non-compliance.
  By nature, CSPs are well suited for network security

## Manageability in the cloud ##

  Management OF the cloud: managing your cloud resources
  - scale resources as needed
  - use preconfigured templates
  - monitor the health of resources
  - receive automatic alerts, real-time performance awareness

  Management IN the cloud: managing your cloud environment
  - using a web portal
  - using CLI
  - using APIs
  - using PowerShell
