## What is cloud computing? ##
- The delivery of computing services over the internet, including:
    - Common IT infrastructure such as VMs, storage, databases, and networking
    - Expands to include IoT, ML, and AI
## Shared responsibility model ##
- Traditional corporate datacenter
      - The company is responsible for maintaining the physical space, ensuring security, and maintaining or replacing the servers.
      - The IT department is responsible for maintaining all the infrastructure and software, system patches
- With shared responsibility model
      - Physical security, power, cooling, and network connectivity are the responsibility of the CSP.
      - The consumer is responsible for the data and information stored in the cloud, including access security.
Example: Cloud SQL database:
      - CSP is responsible for the database
      - Consumer responsible for the data being ingested
          - Deploying a VM and installing SQL, you're responsible for patches and updates
The Spectrum:
  - Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
    - most responsiblity on the consumer, CSP is responsible for physical security, power, connectivity.
  - Software as a Service (SaaS)
    - most responsibility on the CSP.
  - Platform as a Service (PaaS)
    - middle ground

## Define cloud models ##
- Private cloud 
  A cloud that is used by a single entity. High level of control, higher cost.
- Public cloud
  Built, controlled, and maintained by a third-party provider. Purchase services, access and use resources.
- Hybrid cloud
  Uses both public and private clouds, interconnected. Used for temporary demand, flexibility to choose where data is stored.
- Multi-cloud
  Different features from different CSPs. Manage resources and security in all environments.
- Azure Arc
  A set of technologies that helps manage your cloud environment. Any cloud environment.
- Azure VMware Solution
  Private cloud environment. Seamless integration to public or hybrid cloud.

## Consumtion-based model ##
CapEx and OpEx
- Capex
  Typically one-time, tangible resources.
- OpEx
  Spending money on services or products over time.
Cloud computing falls under OpEx, benefits:
- No upfront costs
- No infrastructure costs
- Flexibility
Cloud computing is a way to rent compute power and storage
